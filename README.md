# Disney_+_Hotstar_Clone

I've been working on this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm proud of what I've been able to accomplish. The site includes many of the same features as the real Disney+ platform, such as a homepage with recommended content, search functionality, and Moving sliders.
